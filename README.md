### Summary 
This lab work show efficiency in the use of the tool Linux, as a security analyst working with a research team as part of my job to manage authorization, for this project i would be investigating and updating the  file permissions,i would be checking existing permission on  the file system to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, i will be modifying the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.
### Tools
Linux (command line tool)
Google drive (for documentation)
### Challenge
As a research team files are very valuable assest and authorization should be duly managed,the file system permission has beeen modified to remove unauthorized access and give permission to appropriate user thereby securing the team file system from misuse.
### Action
* Firstly, i displayed current permmission set for the subdirectories and file under the project directory where files are stored,making sure to display hidden files too
* Next, i described the permission strings generated from displaying the permission set list,writing short descriptions that explains the 10-character string using example of one of the displayed files permission string
* Next, according to a new rule set about file permmission, i modified the permission to fit the rule using the "chmod" command line.
* Next, i modified the permmision for a hidden file to fit the organization new rule set about file permmission.
* Finally, i modified the permmission set for a directory to fit proper authorization and give access to only authorized user.
### Result
